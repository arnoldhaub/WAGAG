# What are Git and GitHub.

This is the question we will try to answer through this document.

Put on your seatbelts, we are about to go down!

## What is GIT ?

Thanks to their [website](https://git-scm.com), we have found a quite interesting answer :

> Git is a **free and open source** distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is **easy to learn** and has a **tiny footprint with lightning fast performance**. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like **cheap local branching**, convenient **staging areas**, and **multiple workflows**.

If you do not understand the description, I will kindly propose you to take some time online to find a better answer.

It is not my problem !

## What is GitHub ?

Once again, I went to [GitHub website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) to find a proper answer, and guess what ? I found one ! They have a beautiful website explaining everything. But let us go back to the definition :

> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

For more information, I let you do the work and navigate, as a pirate, through the sea of the Internet. *(Please do not attack other pirates)
